I love mood lighting, and my home is filled with various lava lamps, quirky bulbs, and other fun lights.<br/>
To add a personal touch to my collection, I thought it would be a fantastic idea to create one myself!
I've had my eye on a glass block lamp for quite some time, and now it's the perfect opportunity to make it happen.
To take the visual concept up a notch, I decided to incorporate some fancy RGB electronics ðŸŒˆ.

## Tools

- A 3D printer : I used my Prusa Mini+
- A soldering station : I used a Aixun T3B, [it's great](https://youtu.be/Ds2Xq3dwV30)
- A computer with Google Chrome to configure the WLED software
- Precision screwdrivers
- UV glue : I used Bostik Fix & Flash

## Materials

For this project, I used the following materials:

- A glass block : I used a 19x19x8cm one which I bough at my local hardware store, Leroy Merlin
- An ESP32 microcontroller : I used an [Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400)
- 3 Adafruit RGBW NeoPixel sticks : I used [these ones from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2867). They're great but expensive... See the [WLED Documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/compatible-hardware/#addressable-led-strips) for compatibility with other LED strips.
- A TSOP38238 IR receiver
- A [compatible](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/infrared/) IR remote
- A potentiometer : I used a 10kÎ© one as recommended by the [WLED documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/features/macros/#global-brightness)
- A 5V 3A USB-C power supply : I used one made for the Raspberry Pi 4.
- Black PLA (for the case assembly) and white PLA (for the diffuser) : I used [Prusament](https://prusament.com/) and [Fillamentum](https://fillamentum.com/) PLA.
- Prototyping wire
- M2 screws and heat-set inserts

:::caution ESP32 microcontroller compatibility

WLED is currently not fully compatible with ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3 microcontrollers, see [#966](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/966), [#2735](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/2735), [#1940](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/1940).
Use a regular ESP32 to be sure.

- keep writing this article
- write a note about sourcing glass blocks
- add project sources (stl, wled config, etc.). Maybe on GitHub ?
- add related documentation links (remove them from the text ?)
- Add improvement ideas
