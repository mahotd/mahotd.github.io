I have several decorative lamps in my home, but I've always wanted to make one myself.<br/>
I've had my eye on a glass block lamp for quite some time, and I thought it would be a
good opportunity to make it happen. To take the visual concept up a notch, I decided to
incorporate some fancy RGB electronics ðŸŒˆ.

## Tools

- **3D printer**: Prusa Mini+
- **soldering station**: Aixun T3B ([it's good](https://youtu.be/Ds2Xq3dwV30))
- **computer** (with Google Chrome, to configure the WLED software)
- **precision screwdrivers**
- **UV glue**

## Materials

For this project, I used the following materials:

- **Glass block**: 19x19x8cm block one which I bought at my local hardware store, Leroy Merlin
- **ESP32** microcontroller: [Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400)

:::warning ESP32 microcontroller compatibility

WLED is currently not fully compatible with ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3 microcontrollers, see
[Aircoookie/WLED#966](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/966),
[Aircoookie/WLED#2735](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/2735),
[Aircoookie/WLED#1940](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/1940).
Use a regular ESP32 to be sure.

:::
- **3x RGBW NeoPixel sticks** from Adafruit: [RGBW NeoPixel Stick from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2867).
I'd recommend using [high density flexible strips instead](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2847),
which are cheaper while offering nearly the same pixel density.
- **TSOP38238** IR receiver
- [**IR remote**](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/infrared/)
- **10kÎ© potentiometer** for brightness setting, as recommended by the [WLED documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/features/macros/#global-brightness)
- **5V 3A USB-C power supply**: I used one made for the Raspberry Pi 4, with a built-in switch
- **Black PLA** (for the case assembly) and **white PLA** (for the diffuser)
- **Prototyping wire**
- **M2 screws** and **heat-set inserts**

## TODO
- keep writing this article
- write a note about sourcing glass blocks
- add project sources (stl, wled config, etc.). Maybe on GitHub ?
- add related documentation links (remove them from the text ?)
- add improvement ideas
