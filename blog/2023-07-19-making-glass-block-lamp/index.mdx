I love mood lighting, and my home is filled with various lava lamps, quirky bulbs, and other fun lights.<br/>
To add a personal touch to my collection, I thought it would be a fantastic idea to create one myself!
I've had my eye on a glass block lamp for quite some time, and now it's the perfect opportunity to make it happen.
To take the visual concept up a notch, I decided to incorporate some fancy RGB electronics ðŸŒˆ.

## Tools

- **3D printer** : I used my Prusa Mini+
- **soldering station** : I used a Aixun T3B, [it's great](https://youtu.be/Ds2Xq3dwV30)
- **computer** with Google Chrome, to configure the WLED software
- precision screwdrivers
- UV glue : I used *Bostik Fix & Flash*

## Materials

For this project, I used the following materials:

- **Glass block** : I used a 19x19x8cm one which I bough at my local hardware store, Leroy Merlin
- **ESP32** microcontroller : I used an [Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400)

:::caution ESP32 microcontroller compatibility

WLED is currently not fully compatible with ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3 microcontrollers, see [#966](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/966), [#2735](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/2735), [#1940](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/1940).
Use a regular ESP32 to be sure.

:::
- **3x RGBW NeoPixel sticks** from Adafruit : I used [these ones from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2867). They're great but expensive... See the [WLED Documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/compatible-hardware/#addressable-led-strips) for compatibility with other LED strips.
- **TSOP38238** IR receiver
- [**IR remote**](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/infrared/)
- **10kÎ© potentiometer** for brightness setting, as recommended by the [WLED documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/features/macros/#global-brightness)
- **5V 3A USB-C power supply** : I used one made for the Raspberry Pi 4
- **Black PLA** (for the case assembly) and **white PLA** (for the diffuser)
- **Prototyping wire**
- **M2 screws** and **heat-set inserts**

## TODO
- keep writing this article
- write a note about sourcing glass blocks
- add project sources (stl, wled config, etc.). Maybe on GitHub ?
- add related documentation links (remove them from the text ?)
- Add improvement ideas
