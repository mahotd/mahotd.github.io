I absolutely love mood lighting !

I have several lava lamps, weird bulbs and fun lights in my home, and adding one that I made myself to the collection seemed like a fun idea.

Furthermore, I've been wanting to have a glass block lamp for quite some time now, so the only logical thing to do was to make one myself !

I wanted to improve on the visual concept a bit: I wanted to make it a bit more interesting than the basic ones using only a white light source and a set of colored filters, so I decided to add some fancy RGB electronics to it :rainbow:.

## Materials

For this project, I used the following materials:

- A glass block (I used a 19x19x8cm one which I bough at my local hardware store, Leroy Merlin)
- A 3D printer (I used my Prusa Mini+) with black PLA and white PLA
- An ESP32 microcontroller (I used an [Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400))
- 3 Adafruit RGBW NeoPixel sticks (I used [these ones](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2867))

:::caution ESP32 microcontroller compatibility

WLED is currently not fully compatible with ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3 microcontrollers, see [#966](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/966), [#2735](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/2735), [#1940](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/issues/1940)
