They\'re great but expensive... See the [WLED Documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/compatible-hardware/#addressable-led-strips) for compatibility with other LED strips.\\n- **TSOP38238** IR receiver\\n- [**IR remote**](https://kno.wled.ge/interfaces/infrared/)\\n- **10k\u03a9 potentiometer** for brightness setting, as recommended by the [WLED documentation](https://kno.wled.ge/features/macros/#global-brightness)\\n- **5V 3A USB-C power supply** : I used one made for the Raspberry Pi 4\\n- **Black PLA** (for the case assembly) and **white PLA** (for the diffuser)\\n- **Prototyping wire**\\n- **M2 screws** and **heat-set inserts**\\n\\n## The case\\n\\nTODO\\n\\n## Electronics\\n\\nTODO\\n\\n## Assembly\\n\\nTODO\\n\\n## WLED\\n\\nTODO\\n\\n## TODO\\n- keep writing this article\\n- write a note about sourcing glass blocks\\n- add project sources (stl, wled config, etc.). Maybe on GitHub ?\\n- add related documentation links (remove them from the text ?)\\n- Add improvement ideas"}]}')}}]);
